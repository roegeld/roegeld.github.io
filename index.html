  <p><b>Disclaimer:</b>This page is not my main page, and I don't
    have a main page (home page) (anymore). I used to have one, but the
pages and information have multiplied and become scattered. I have therefore
given up on having a "main" page. I try
instead to connect the different pages together.

<p>I therefore provide links here to a (non-exhaustive) list
of sites containing elements of my activities and work.
Other pages may be more complete, or some
may be incomplete. It is also possible
that the information on this page may at some point
be transferred elsewhere, in whole or in part (this may depend on
GitHub, for example). It's complicated, I know,
but I don't have the time to do better.

<p>I also don't have time to waste making a sales presentation; it serves absolutely no purpose for me.

<p>So, my main general pages are:
  
    <ul>
      <li>My (very incomplete) <a href="https://members.loria.fr/Roegel">professional page</a>
	      at LORIA.
      <li>My <a href="https://roegel.wixsite.com/science/">independent researcher page</a> (also very incomplete).
    </ul>

<p>As you can see, my activities cover two main themes
which are roughly correlated with my roles as a professional researcher
and an independent researcher.

<p>Professionally, I do a lot of research on
the history of mathematics, the history of computation, particularly numerical tables,
but also on mechanical computation and other types of computations.
I am also <a href="3D">interested in modeling,
not only in 3D</a>. Much of my professional research (but not only) is grouped on the following page:

  <ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://locomat.loria.fr">LOCOMAT project</a>
	(with among others some of my work on <a href="https://locomat.loria.fr/locomat/tools.html">mechanical computation</a>)
    </ul>

<p>At the independent level, I do much the same thing, but
by applying it to scientific and technical heritage, which I study,
analyze, compare, document, and campaign for its preservation.
This is not, contrary to what some people think, separate
from my professional activity. I recently received the <a href="https://www.ahsoc.org/resources/prizes-and-awards/dr-alan-shenton-award/">Alan Shenton
Award</a> for this work.

<p>It turns out that I've examined a lot of machines, such as
<a href="https://horloges.github.io/">tower
clocks</a> (they're pretty much the simplest kind of machines)
and I've also worked extensively in archives (but also
for my work in the history of mathematics), and I've made
correlations between works and their archives. I have been led
to work on <a href="tresors.html">museum collections</a>
or on works tied to heritage administrations, etc.,
which has led me to (request) access to
archives. Like any self-respecting researcher, I also have to do
critical work, and this work greatly displeases certain
curators in heritage administrations or museums who, in fact, don't understand
what I do.

<p>Here are some more recent, more specific pages:
